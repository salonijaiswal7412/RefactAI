❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
function sum(){return a+b;}
```

🔍 Issues:
* ❌ The function `sum` attempts to add `a` and `b` without them being defined within the function scope or passed as
arguments. This will lead to errors because `a` and `b` are undefined.
* ❌ Lack of parameter definitions. The function `sum` should accept two arguments to perform addition meaningfully.
* ❌ No explicit return type defined, which can cause confusion or unexpected behavior in larger applications (though
JavaScript is dynamically typed).

✅ Recommended Fix:

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
return a + b;
}
```

💡 Improvements:
* ✔ Includes parameters `a` and `b` in the function definition, allowing values to be passed for addition.
* ✔ Returns the sum of `a` and `b`.
* ✔ Clearer in intent: the function explicitly shows that it expects two arguments to perform the sum.
